Lets make the next indicator: Equity Index Put–Call Ratio (Positioning / Hedging Tone) What:
Put–call volume or open interest ratio for index options (SPX/SPY), not single stocks.
Why:
Very low index put–call → complacency / call-chasing.
Very high levels could either be fear or heavy hedging, depending on context—but extremes are still informative.
Where:
CBOE publishes daily put–call ratio data for index options and for total markets.
Some brokers expose these time series via API or data downloads.
Implementation note:
Track index put–call vs its own 5–10y history (z-score).
Consider also equity-only put–call; divergence between the two can be interesting. Here are data sources For an index put–call ratio (SPX/SPXW preferred), you have three practical “go-to” sources. Two are free directly from Cboe (best starting point); one is paid but API-friendly.
1) Cboe Daily Market Statistics (free; best for “today”)
Use Cboe’s Daily Market Statistics page with a date parameter:
Endpoint pattern (HTML):
https://www.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?dt=YYYY-MM-DD
That page publishes (among other fields) the daily:
INDEX PUT/CALL RATIO
EQUITY PUT/CALL RATIO
TOTAL PUT/CALL RATIO
and, importantly for your “index options, not single stocks” requirement:
SPX + SPXW PUT/CALL RATIO (S&P 500 index options)
This is the cleanest free source for a daily pull; your app would scrape the table values for the ratios you want.
2) Cboe CSV archives (free; best for multi-year history)
Cboe also hosts downloadable CSV archives on its CDN. These are ideal for building your 5–10y history and z-scores.
Commonly used files include:
Equity put/call (equity options aggregate):
https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/options/volume_and_call_put_ratios/equitypc.csv
Index volume + put/call archive (index options aggregate):
https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/options/volume_and_call_put_ratios/indexpcarchive.csv
Put/call ratio archive (total/combined archive):
https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/options/volume_and_call_put_ratios/pcratioarchive.csv
(If you also track volatility complex hedging tone) VIX put/call series:
https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/options/volume_and_call_put_ratios/vixpc.csv
Cboe indexes these and related files from its “Historical Options Data Download” page.
Important nuance: the “Index” CSV is aggregate index options, not strictly SPX-only. If you want SPX/SPXW specifically, the daily statistics page explicitly publishes SPX + SPXW put/call.
