Here is a concrete “starter pack” of 10 indicators, plus where you can actually pull each one. I’ll keep it to data you can either get for free or approximate reasonably without a Bloomberg terminal.

---

## 1. Equity Volatility Term Structure (VIX vs 3M VIX)

**What:**

* Spot VIX (1-month implied volatility on S&P 500 options).
* 3-month VIX (VIX3M).
* Use the **slope** = VIX3M – VIX as your indicator (backwardation vs contango).

**Why:**

* When front-month volatility spikes above 3M (backwardation), it’s often a sign of acute stress.

**Where to get it (free-ish):**

* CBOE publishes VIX and VIX3M quotes and historical data.
* Many brokers / charting platforms (TradingView, etc.) provide these tickers in real time:

  * `^VIX` and `^VIX3M` on Yahoo Finance.

**Implementation note:**

* Download daily close from Yahoo (via yfinance or similar) and compute `VIX3M – VIX` + z-score.

---

## 2. Rates Volatility (MOVE Index)

**What:**

* ICE BofA MOVE Index = implied volatility on US Treasuries across key maturities.

**Why:**

* Spikes often precede or coincide with big macro/bond shocks that later hit equities.

**Where:**

* ICE and many data vendors publish the index.
* Public ticker on Yahoo Finance: `^MOVE`.
* ICE provides methodology and sometimes historical charts on their site.

**Implementation note:**

* Same as VIX: track level and z-score vs 5–10 year history.

---

## 3. High-Yield Credit Spread (HY OAS)

**What:**

* Option-adjusted spread of US high-yield corporate bonds over Treasuries.

**Why:**

* Credit stress is one of the best early warnings for broader risk-off.

**Where (free):**

* The St. Louis Fed (FRED) has a series such as:

  * **BAMLH0A0HYM2** (“ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread”) with daily data.

**Implementation note:**

* Pull from FRED API, track level and change; z-score vs history.

---

## 4. HY vs IG Credit Spread Ratio

**What:**

* Ratio of high-yield spread to investment-grade spread (HY OAS / IG OAS).

**Why:**

* Shows whether stress is concentrated in riskier credit; a rising ratio is often more informative than levels alone.

**Where (free):**

* FRED has an IG OAS series, e.g.:

  * **BAMLC0A0CM** or similar ICE BofA US Corporate IG OAS series.

**Implementation note:**

* Pull both HY and IG spreads from FRED and compute the ratio.
* Normalize that ratio over time (z-score).

---

## 5. FRA–OIS or TED Spread (Funding Stress)

**What:**

* **TED spread**: 3-month LIBOR (now SOFR-linked equivalents) minus 3-month Treasury bill yield.
* Or a more modern variant: 3M FRA – 3M OIS spread.

**Why:**

* Measures perceived bank/credit risk vs “risk-free” government bills; spikes → interbank stress.

**Where (free / approximate):**

* FRED has TED spread series, e.g. **TEDRATE** (historical TBILL vs LIBOR).
* You can approximate FRA–OIS using futures and OIS rate data if you have access via brokerage or paid data.

**Implementation note:**

* For a DIY early warning, using the FRED TEDRATE is usually sufficient.

---

## 6. HY Bond ETF Discount/Premium to NAV

**What:**

* Discount/premium of large HY ETFs (e.g., HYG, JNK) vs their net asset values.

**Why:**

* Persistent discount (ETF trading below NAV) indicates **liquidity stress**: underlying bonds are harder to trade than the ETF.

**Where:**

* ETF providers (iShares for HYG, State Street for JNK) publish **daily NAV and closing price**.
* Many brokers expose this data, or you can scrape/public APIs where allowed.

**Implementation note:**

* Compute `(Price – NAV) / NAV` daily.
* Track both level and multi-day persistence of negative values.

---

## 7. Yield Curve Slope (3m–10y or 2s–10s)

**What:**

* Difference between long and short rates, e.g.:

  * 10-year Treasury yield minus 3-month T-bill yield (10y – 3m), or
  * 10-year minus 2-year (2s10s).

**Why:**

* Inversion is a classic recession predictor; **re-steepening from inversion** often coincides with transition toward real pain.

**Where (free):**

* FRED has both:

  * 10-year constant maturity: **DGS10**
  * 2-year: **DGS2**
  * 3-month: **DGS3MO**

**Implementation note:**

* Compute slope daily and monitor:

  * Is curve inverted?
  * Is it steepening rapidly?

---

## 8. Equity Risk Premium Proxy (Earnings Yield – Real Yield)

**What:**

* Simple approximation:

  * S&P 500 **earnings yield** (1 / P/E or forward E/P)
    – 10-year **real yield** (e.g., via TIPS).

**Why:**

* When this gets very compressed, equities are “priced for perfection”; any shock elsewhere (credit, macro) can do more damage.

**Where:**

* S&P 500 earnings yield / P/E:

  * S&P Global / multpl.com type sites have long-term P/E data (historical Shiller CAPE and regular P/E).
* 10-year TIPS yield from FRED:

  * **DFII10** (10-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security).

**Implementation note:**

* Don’t treat this as timing; use as a **background fragility score** or multiplier on your other indicators.

---

## 9. Equity Index Put–Call Ratio (Positioning / Hedging Tone)

**What:**

* Put–call volume or open interest ratio for **index** options (SPX/SPY), not single stocks.

**Why:**

* Very low index put–call → complacency / call-chasing.
* Very high levels could either be fear or heavy hedging, depending on context—but extremes are still informative.

**Where:**

* CBOE publishes daily put–call ratio data for index options and for total markets.
* Some brokers expose these time series via API or data downloads.

**Implementation note:**

* Track index put–call vs its own 5–10y history (z-score).
* Consider also **equity-only** put–call; divergence between the two can be interesting.

---

## 10. Broad Financial Conditions Index (One Composite Input)

**What:**

* A pre-built **financial conditions index (FCI)** that aggregates rates, spreads, FX, and equity moves into a single score.

**Why:**

* Gives you a “big picture” context without rebuilding everything from scratch.
* Can serve as a sanity check on your custom composite.

**Where:**

* Chicago Fed **National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI)** via FRED:

  * Weekly data, with historical series available.
* Other FCIs (Goldman Sachs, etc.) tend to be paywalled or only partially public.

**Implementation note:**

* Pull NFCI weekly; compare its z-score to your own composite to see when they diverge.

---

## How This Fits Together

With these 10 indicators you have:

* **Volatility:** VIX term structure, MOVE
* **Credit:** HY OAS, HY/IG spread ratio
* **Funding & Liquidity:** TED/FRA–OIS, HY ETF discount/premium
* **Macro/Curve:** Yield curve slope, NFCI
* **Valuation / Fragility:** Equity risk premium proxy
* **Positioning / Sentiment:** Index put–call ratio

In a next step, we can:

1. Assign each indicator to a “bucket” (vol, credit, etc.).
2. Normalize each series (rolling z-scores).
3. Build a simple composite “Risk Regime Score” in Python, with logic such as:

   * Equal-weighted z-scores by bucket.
   * Optional multiplier when valuation fragility is high.
4. Backtest against forward drawdowns in S&P or your own portfolio.

If you would like, I can draft a small Python sketch that:

* pulls a subset of these (say from FRED + Yahoo),
* computes z-scores, and
* outputs a daily composite “risk regime” series that you can experiment with.
